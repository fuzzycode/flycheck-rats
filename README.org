  (RATS) from CERN.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package flycheck-rats
      :after flycheck
      :config (flycheck-rats-setup))
  #+END_SRC

  To make sure that it gets executed, make sure that it is added to the list of
  checkers by calling something like.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Make sure to replace ~c/c++-cppcheck~ for the checker that you want to have
